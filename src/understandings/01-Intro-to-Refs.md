### Refs

#### Connecting and Access HTML elements via refs

- Q. What are Refs? and How can we simplify this(Player.jsx) component with Refs?

- A ref in a React is just a value, just as the state in the end is a value and just as a variable contains a value. BUT its a special kind of value. or It is managed by react in a special way to be precise.
